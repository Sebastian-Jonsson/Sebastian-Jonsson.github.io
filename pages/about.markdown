Heyooo!
This is a blog made for the educational purposes of me, Sebastian Jonsson.

My origins are not so far and widely known but I can tell that I came from humble beginings and was raised in a medium-sized town, in some cases considered a small town, don't have everything there but enough to get by an everyday life.

To describe myself would be better to explain my interests which are somewhat unorthodox to some and are in a minority. 

I'll give a few examples:

Anime

Fantasy

Sci-fi

Storywriting

Roleplay

Dark, sarcastic, dry, morbid - Humor

Betting on the villain in movies

Bending laws and testing boundaries?

Just a small town boy... Livin' in a lonely world
He took the daytime train, goin' studyin'
