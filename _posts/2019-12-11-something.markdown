The morning came and smelled of various oily steams from the workshops and smiths down the street, production was fully ongoing as per any day. The smoke could be seen rising from the billowing forges and houses. It was cold and the summer was long gone, the leaves of the trees in the city had changed color to a more orange and brown rather than the early autumn yellow. 
A strong breeze swept through the street and a brief fresh scent of air was had before the workshops alchemical scents took over once again.
Inside of a dark oak building with rough edges on the outside and a chimney that already was spewing forth a small trickle of smoke. 

A room inside is very warm and not at all as filled with the scent of the streets but there is no window either to provide any light, there is a door inside this otherwise modest room leading to a balcony about five feet out and ten feet wide with a simple and weatherworn railing. A table sits upon it along with a chair with seemingly leather-straps attached to it, a device to fasten someone or something perhaps.

What is inside however is much more appealing with a half filled bookcase from floor to ceiling with various titles. A desk is placed neatly in a corner with a very simple yet sturdy design. A wardrobe with very few clothing choices is situated next to the other door leading to the rest of the house and in the center of it all rests a bed pushed up against the far wall. The space is cramped and various knickknacks are scattered across the room.

The blanket of the bed rises slowly and sinks once again, repeating itself a couple of times before an arm flails wide up into the air and slams itself into the wall behind and as it hits the wall a loud yelp can be heard as all of a sudden the blanket pounces off of the bed and appears to roll down the floor with a loud thud.
Seconds pass and a long-winded groan can be heard from the pile next to the bed as the blanket opens up and a young woman appears from within her brief blanket prison with her arms spread wide next to her on the floor and panting in surprise at her recent awakening.
