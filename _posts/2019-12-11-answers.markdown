My blog page contains a mixture of Swedish and English.

Below are the questions and my answers to them:

What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS? -- 
I like the ease of maintenance with it and it also gives organized way of going through the code which I much prefer.

Compare to regular CSS -- 
Compared to regular CSS I enjoy it because of the above stated difference, it gives me a better overlook of the code and it is simpler to organize it.

Which techniques did you use? -- 
I used the common tools such as altering the color of text and backgrounds with CSS. Another thing is that I added a few things by making new id's such as borders and adding additional separating color themes there.

Pros and cons? -- 
It was alot like managing regular CSS but with the advantage of it being easier to find the different places.
Keeps the CSS DRY, a plus.
A downside is that I don't currently know everything about how it's built up from the bottom up and thus don't understand it entirely.
Without any prior basic CSS knowledge I imagine it would have been a bit more confusing.
